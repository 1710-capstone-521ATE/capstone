# 521ATE

521ATE is an event-coordinating mobile application that allows users to decide on a meal within minutes, with restaurants generated from a geographical midpoint. A fullstack application incorporating React-Native, Koa, Socket.io, Yelp API, and Apple Maps API. Created by the capstone team at Fullstack Academy: Samuel Kwon, Jason Ioannides, Sandy Mak, and Sarah Zhao.

## Motivation
Eating out is fun, but planning a dinner event is complicated. 521ATE's goal was to alleviate the age-old issue of planning an outing amongst a busy group of friends in the city who only have a few hours to meet. Our motivation was to maintain a smooth user interface to allow users to decide on a location within minutes as we handled nested data queries on a headless server.
